# File Naming

- Files should be `kebab-cased`

# Function Naming

- Functions should match the name of the file.
  - if the file is a component then it should be named like this `MyComponent` and file name should be `my-component.tsx`
  - if the file is a utility funciton then it should be named `myFunction` and file name `my-function`

## Types

- Types should be defined in their own files for maximum reuse i.e if there is Event type then it and its related types should be defined inside `event.types.ts`. Note this is needed IF types are defined

## Other Dev notes (AI Reviwer)

- If you see any console.logs, please comment and kindly ask the author to remove it.
