# File Naming

- Files should be `kebab-cased`

# Function Naming

- Functions should match the name of the file.
  - if the file is a component then it should be named like this `MyComponent` and file name should be `my-component.tsx`
  - if the file is a utility funciton then it should be named `myFunction` and file name `my-function`
